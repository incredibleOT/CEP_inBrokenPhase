1) General
This Programs should determin the "phase structure" from the CEP, while still assuming to be in the broken phase.
using the potentials in chapter 9 and 10 of the notes.

There are two potentials being used. The one that was already used by Phillip Gerhold, where teh Higgs boson mass appears
in the Potential itself requiring an iterative approach to find a self consistent solution (U_1) and a n ansatz where 
the gaussian contributions from the self couplings are taken into acocunt when integrating out the non-zero modes of the bosonic
field leading to logarithmic corrections to the potential (U_2). The second approach does not rely on a self consistent sollution.

2) Programs
a) For determining the phase structure there are two programs:
CEPscan_inBrokenPhase (using U_1) and CEPscan_withFullBosDet (using U_2).
The principle is the following:

 - we use the continuum notation (m_0^2, lambda, y, lambda_6), but keep all lattice expressions like sums etc
 - we set all parameters, also m_0^2
 - now the program iterates
   {
 	- determine minimum
 	- determin mass in the minimum
 	- iteratre until a self consistent sollution is found for U_1
   }

b) For both potentials there is a program which allows to get teh potential for a wider range of $\hat v$. This exists for both potentials:
plotPotential_inBrokenPhase (U_1) and plotPotential_withFullBosDet(U_2).

3) How to use
Each program works with input files containing a name-values pair in each line. There are template input files for each program. 
Most of them are somewhat self explaining.

The parameters for CEPscan_inBrokenPhase and CEPscan_withFullBosDet that both have in common are:
 - L_s, L_t, antiperiodic_L_t : spatial, temporal extent and whether boundary conditions for the fermions in time are atiperiodic
 - scan_m0Squared : Whether a scan in m_0^2 should be perfomed (in contrast to only use 1 value)
 - m0Squared: If there should be o scan performed, but only a single value will be used, set m0^2 by this parameter
 - m0Squared_min, m0Squared_max, m0Squared_step: If a scan should be performed, the scan will be done from m0Squared_min to m0Squared_max in
   steps of m0Squared_step
 - Similarly to teh way it works for m0Squared, te parameters lambda, lambda_6, yukawa_t and yukawa_ratio work, where yukawa_ratio is y_t/y_b
 - use_kappa: If this flag is set, kappa will be used as input instead of m0^2. In this case any parameters for m0^2 are ignored. Internally m0^2 will be used,
   but m0^2 will be determined from kappa and lambda
 - N_f, rho, r: N_f, rho (from overlap) and wilson parameter (if not set, default values will be used)
 - absolut_tolerance_for_minimization, relative_tolerance_for_minimization: Those set the tolerance for the minimizer in finding the location of the minimum
 - minimization_algorithm: The algorithm used for the minimizer (choice between the three minimizers offered by gsl)
 - max_numer_of_iterations_minimizer: maximal number of iterations for the inimizer
 - testvalue_min, testvalue_max, testvalue_step: before the minimizer starts, a rough scan is performed to find an initial interval for the minimization
   procedure. It is neccessary to find an interval which contains the minimum. If the minimum is at the border of the interval, the program will fail.
   This especially important, if the minimum can be at zero, which can only happen, if antiperiodic BCs are turned on. In that case, the start interval should 
   start at negative field values. Since the potential is symmetric, findin a minimum at $\hat v <0$ is not a problem.
 - outputfile: The output file. For the name one can use abbreviations that will be replaced by the parameters used, so you do
   not have to change the output file name each time you change the parameters. The following things are possible:
   [Ls], [Lt]: will be replaced by Lxx and Tyy with xx being L_s and yy being L_t
   [l]: will be replaced by l_xx with xx being the lambda-value used if just one value for lambda is used. In case of a scan being performed,
        the replacemet will be l_yy_zz with yy being lambda_min and zz being lambda_z
   [l6], [y], [yr]: the same as for [l] but with lambda_6, yukawa_t and yukawa_ratio
   [m0Sq_k]: Also works the same but with m0Sq or k in case of usage of m0Squared or kappa

The following parameters are only relevant for CEPscan_inBrokenPhase:
 - tolerance_for_HiggsMassSquared: The tolerance for the Higgs boson mass which stops the itartion process for finding a self consistent solution
 - max_numer_of_iterations_HiggsMassSquared: Maximal number of iterations in finding the Higgs boson mass
 - use_listOfFermContr, listOfFermContr: Whether a file with the fermionic contributions for a set of $\hat v$ should be used and its location.
   Since the computation of the fermionic contributions dominates the cmputational effort, it might be reasonable to store those and get the 
   contributions from that file. The program  generate_list_of_fermionic_contribution generates those list. (can in principle also be used for 
   CEPscan_withFullBosDet, but it is not implemented there.
 - exclude_goldstones: if set, goldstone contributions will be ignored
 
 
The Input parameter files for plotPotential_inBrokenPhase and plotPotential_withFullBosDet work similarly, but without the possibility to scan in parameters
