This Program should determin the "phase structure" from the CEP, while still assuming to be in the broken phase.

The prrinciple is the following:

 - we use the continuum notation (m_0^2, lambda, y, lambda_6), but keep all lattice expressions like sums etc
 - The potential we use is the one for the determination of the lower bound
 - we set all parameters, also m_0^2
 - now the program iterates
   {
 	- determine minimum
 	- determin mass in the minimum
 	- set mass in propagator sum
   }
   until the minimum is stable
